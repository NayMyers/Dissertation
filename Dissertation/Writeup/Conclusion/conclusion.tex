  \subsection{Further Work}
    The design of the API lends itself to easily being extended to include more endpoints. This can enable the API in the future to handle requests to different models for different classification problems. One possible usage of this extensibility is that of automated pest/weed contol. Whereby the system would include using drones to destroy weeds in crop feilds automatically. Aditionally, a model may be trained to analyse aerial photographs of land, to determine if conservation/re-wilding targets are being met.

    A way of integrating the model API with even futher applications is using blockchain technlology. Currently there exists a service known as Chainlink (https://chain.link/). Which aims to be a middleware to bring external API feeds to existing blockchains. This could stand as a way of monetizing the usage of image classificaiton or other AI services, such as recurrant neural networks (RNN) for text sentiment analysis, music generation or image uplscaling etc.
